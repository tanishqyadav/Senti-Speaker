# Senti-Speaker
Here I made an Approach to a project where you can add audio speech which further saved in a text file & then corrects its spells & grammar a little bit. eventually, after this its perform a sentiment analysis on that and come up with the results in parallel it gives you an audio output of correct speech too. And I give this a name that is "Senti Speaker". You Can also get the feature of Graphical representation too of your sentiment analysis result.
